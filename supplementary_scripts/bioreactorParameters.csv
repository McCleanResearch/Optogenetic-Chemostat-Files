Variable,Value,Description (no commas allowed!)
numParameters,25,Number of subsequent parameters/variables excluding this value. Thus it will be the line number minus 2.
rootDir,C:\\Users\\NIKON\\Pictures\\2016_05_19_testing_CSV_import\\,This is where data relevant to this experiment will be saved.
retroAnalysis,0,"Set to 1 if you would like to reanalyze images that were taken during a previous experiment and saved in the saveDir folder. Otherwise set to 0. Note that the microscope will not be controlled but micro manager's stage position list should have the number of positions that will be analyzed. For this purpose, these positions can be arbitrary."
nrImages,672,"This is only needed if ""retroAnalysis""=1. It is the number of image sets to reanalyze"
controllerPort,COM4,This is the USB port that the relay board is attached to. On Windows this can be found via Control Panel>Device Manager>Ports
controllerInterval,30000,"This is the interval (in milliseconds) over which the ratio of time that a pump should be on is set. So if mediaRatioOn=0.333 and controllerInterval=30000, the the media pump will be on for 10 seconds and off for 20 seconds. The script needs to know this because it must now what the minimum delay between successive image periods should be when it is aqcuiring background images (so that it doesn't image the same thing twice before the pump is turned back on to shift the culture)."
mediaRatioOn,0.62,This indicates the ratio of time that the media pump will be ON during each 30 second interval
sampleRatioOn,0.5,This indicates the ratio of time that the media pump will be ON during each 30 second interval
durationMillis,86400000,"Set this variable to the number of milliseconds that an experiment should run. For example, if the experiment should run for 1 day then assign it the value of 86400000."
bgSamples,5,Number of background images to take per image location. Odd number >1 recommended because the median intensity at each pixel location is used.
stageIntervals,5,"If the position list has only 2 positions it replaces them with this many positions along the x y z axis formed by the two positions (not recommended, it is better to pick every single position individually using micro manger's stage position list)."
settlingTime,60000,This is the time in milliseconds that sampled culture chouls be let to settle before an image is taken. The peristaltic pump will be off during this time until the end of the image aqcuisition period.
configGroup,Filters,Micromanager configuration group
configPresetFind,1-DIC,This is the preset of the configuration group by which images will be acquired to find regions of interest (cells)
configPresetAnalyze,5-YFP,This is the preset of the configuration group by which images will be acquired to find analyze the intensity of the regions of interest  (cells)
configPresetDark,Dark,Set this to the preset that will be used between images. Ideally a dark one.
imageTypeName,Tiff,This refers to how imageJ calls the file type and is called when saving images.
imageTypeSuffix,.tiff,This refers to its actual file suffix and is used when retrieving files.
analyzeParticlesParameters,size=2000-15000 circularity=0.50-1.00 exclude include add,Size is in units of pixels. These parameters were generated by recording commands as beanshell inputs while using the Analyze Particles GUI
lineSeparator,\r\n,End the string with \r\n for Windows and \n for Unix
commandTerminator,e,This is the set of characters that indicates the end of a command from the microcontroller
dataFile,Summary,Name of .csv file containing summary information of the experiment. Name will be concatenated with the date and time
translationFile,Translations,The offest applied between images acquired by configPresetFind and images acquired by configPresetAnalyze is stored here. The offest is recorded in pixels after software attempts to find the optimal alignedment. This can correct systematic misalignments between the presets.
temperatureFile,Temperature,The temperature as recorded by the microcontroller is saved here. The time and PWM current to the heating pad are also recorded.
controllerMessageDelay,1000,"This is the time, in milliseconds, that the script should delay between sending each message to the controller. The controller's message buffer can overflow if this delay is too short. When it overflows, no error message will be sent, so err on the side of an excessive delay."
controlMicroscope,0,"Set this to 0 if the microscope should not be controlled (no images acquired, no stage movement). This is useful when troubleshooting the microcontroler. Set to 1 is this is a real experiment where images should be aqcuired."
